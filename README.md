Transfer Learning-Based Skin Cancer Classification Using Deep Learning.
This research proposes a deep transfer learning framework aimed at classifying skin cancer from dermoscopic images. The goal is to develop a robust, high-performance system that leverages pre-trained deep learning models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of skin cancer detection. This approach reduces the need for large amounts of labeled data while improving model performance on smaller datasets typical in dermatology.
